<div id="wash">THE BEGINNING: I bought this cat from some people in a shady neighborhood. I originally wanted a black cat. He was the only kitten who was interested in me. You could almost say that he chose me. It was true love almost immediately.</div>
<br /><div id="hawaii">THE SAD ENDING: I had to find him a new home and move to Hawaii. I couldn't bear to have the cat sit in quarantine, nor to have him fly such a long distance. It was one of the most heartbreaking moments of my life. I did end up finding a family that was perfect for him. They were great. The wife paid $100 for Atticus & then sent me pictures yearly for the first 2 years.</div>
